title: Getting Started

Welcome to the Kin Developers' Documentation.  Here you will find everything you need to get started with integrating
your app with Kin.  By the end of this you'll have all the necessary information to allow your users to start earning,
spending and managing Kin within your app.

First we'll start with some high level explanations with our "Kin Architecture Overview" where you'll learn
about all of the high level components that make up a Kin application.  Next we'll move onto "How It Works" where
we'll dig a little deeper and discuss a few things that you'll need to know about the flow of a Kin app before diving 
into our technical documenation.  Then you can check out our "Developer Checklist" where you can see all the necessary
pieces that you'll need to develop a Kin app in both our Test and Production environments.

Once you feel comfortable with all of the high level information it's the perfect time to move to our technical docs.
We have client SDK docs for iOS, Android and Unity.  As well as server SDK docs for Python and Node.js.  
We also have Hello World tutorials for each of our SDKs to help get you even more famliar with building Kin apps before
you begin your integration.
