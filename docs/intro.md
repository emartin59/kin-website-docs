Welcome to the Kin Developer documentation. Here you'll find everything you need to allow your users to earn, spend, and manage Kin.

## What You Can Build with Kin

Kin helps you create amazing peer-to-peer experiences in your app. Kin is a digital currency, it's money, but it's built in a way that makes it really easy to send micro-transactions between users. Think of Kin as a way for users to micro-gift each other in your app, kind of like a digital high-five and also away for your users to puchase digital content in your app

What's more, by being built on Kin your app joins a [growing ecosystem](https://www.kin.org/stats/) of other apps that use Kin. That means that your users can earn Kin in one app and spend it in another. Kin doesnâ€™t just live in one app. When you use Kin, your users get access to an entire ecosystem of apps that put them at the center.

## Monetizing Your App with Kin

Kin can be a monetization strategy for your app. To monetize your app using Kin, you can collect transaction fees for user transactions using Kin. This is done manually. In your app, you will show the user your transaction fee. Then you will make two Kin transactions - one to the destination address, and one to your app's wallet address with the amount you collect as a fee.
